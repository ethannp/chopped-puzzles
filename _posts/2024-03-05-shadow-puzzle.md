I discovered this <a href="https://twitter.com/papillotecontet" target="_blank">Japanese puzzle creator</a> who makes super cute puzzles. Here's one of their puzzles you should solve first:

Translated rules: Place 3 blocks (1x1x3), then reunite the monsters. The monsters can only move in shadow. They cannot jump or climb the blocks, and the blocks can be placed in any orientation (but they must be grid-aligned).

I was then inspired to make a similar puzzle! The same rules apply, except you now place four blocks.
