This is my first time constructing a puzzle so large! I really like this variant of Heyawake (if you couldn't tell), as I feel like there are a lot of cool deductions with touching regions not having the same number. I tried to explore many of those deductions in this puzzle. I challenged myself to make this puzzle free of any numbers and with all rectangular regions, which I successfully accomplished! Another goal I had was to make the solve path not have any long bifurcations like some of the other <abbr title="What I call the variant, a Heyawake + Shimaguni portmanteau">Shimawake</abbr> puzzles I've set. It's up to you on how well I did that - there is a completely logical solution. I hope you enjoy!

Rules: Normal Heyawake rules apply. Additionally, regions that share a border cannot have the same number of shaded cells.
